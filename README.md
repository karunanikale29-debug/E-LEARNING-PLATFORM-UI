As part of my front-end development internship, I was assigned the task of designing and developing the front-end of an E-Learning Platform. The objective of this task was to create a styled, interactive, and multi-page user interface using core front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This task helped me understand how real-world educational platforms are structured and how different front-end components work together to provide a smooth user experience.

The first step of this task was planning the structure of the application. I identified the key features required for an e-learning platform, such as course listing, course detail pages with video content, and progress tracking for users. Based on this, I decided to create three main pages: a Courses page (index.html), a Course Detail page (course.html), and a Dashboard page (dashboard.html). Each page serves a specific purpose and is connected using navigation links to ensure smooth movement between pages.

The Courses page acts as the home page of the platform. On this page, I displayed multiple course cards, each containing the course title, a short description, and a “View Course” button. This page was designed using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. Flexbox was used to arrange course cards neatly, making the layout clean and user-friendly. Navigation links were added at the top to allow users to easily access the dashboard.

The Course Detail page focuses on content delivery. On this page, I embedded a video tutorial using an iframe, simulating how online learning platforms deliver video-based lessons. Below the video, I added a “Mark as Completed” button. When the user clicks this button, JavaScript is triggered to store the course completion status using the browser’s localStorage. This approach allows progress data to persist even after refreshing the page, making the platform more interactive and realistic.

The Dashboard page was created to display the user’s learning progress. This page includes a progress bar and text indicating the percentage of course completion. JavaScript retrieves the stored progress value from localStorage and dynamically updates the progress bar and text. This feature demonstrates how front-end logic can be used to reflect user actions across different pages without using a backend.

For styling, I used CSS to maintain a consistent color scheme, typography, and spacing across all pages. A blue-and-white theme was chosen to give the platform a professional and educational look. Buttons, headers, and cards were styled to improve visual appeal and usability. The layout was kept simple and beginner-friendly while still following basic UI/UX principles.

Throughout this task, I worked in Visual Studio Code, organizing files into proper folders such as css for stylesheets and js for JavaScript files. This helped me understand the importance of project structure and clean code organization in front-end development. I also used browser testing and Live Server to preview changes in real time and fix layout or functionality issues.

In conclusion, this task allowed me to gain hands-on experience in building a multi-page front-end application from scratch. I learned how to link multiple HTML pages, embed videos, apply consistent styling, and add interactivity using JavaScript. This project strengthened my understanding of front-end fundamentals and gave me confidence in creating user-friendly web interfaces suitable for real-world applications like e-learning platforms.
